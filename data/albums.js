          lyrics:
            'No longer burdened by youth Not burning and open and raw like a wound And shopping is much easier now I can be quiet and private and protected In a compartment tucked away real tight I’ll ride my bike til the sun goes down Singing songs of no reason while no one’s around And when it gets dark I will continue to stay out With my gray hairs all on the ground With something new to romanticize They’ll all leave without you They always will We can hold hands if we promise to go to the same place At the same exact time I will keep my grasp tight Until we part ways then we can both disappear If I avoid you then you can’t abandon me I can focus on my tasks so fervently Everything is much easier now My beliefs unchallenged thus calcified In a compartment tucked away real tight',

          lyrics:
            'Looking for footing while doing it’s best impression of Being human meanwhile up on hind legs at the podium Meanwhile That neon cartoon tries to explain its presence in an unclear and roundabout way And starts to itch ‘Grifting is encouraged’ Campaigning, shaking hands, kissing babies and some cloaked pandering ‘I don’t eat mine’ They are of you all and you are the ones that they need And they fall for it Beaten down by a sleight of hand But it has no taste Provides no sustenance It still ends up at the table With my lone offering My lone offering',

            'I used to think There was just one puppeteer pulling on all the strings But now It seems like we’re all tugging on something In one big ol’ tangled mess I feel some hair that‘s hanging off of me It’s not mine nor do I want it to be I will pull for you if that’s what you want me to do But I like to walk fast and I demand you allow me to I went from one reason to none To as many as I could argue And back to zero Because I could fight but I don’t want to I’d rather recite my fate What I often offer gets trapped in how I speak By what I love or what I despise but usually by each I’m hung up on being untethered in a way that agrees with me: With the door open',

            'Betting on horses That are all making their way Each one in a different direction At the designed center of their universe I am Feeling slight pressure now But I appear, so far, to be Managing all of them well My desperate attempts to cheat death and time Rely on more recent myths And modern fiction and sending inverted curses and casting subversive spells I’m measured now Regimented and restrained and refined Watching my behavior I’ve pared it down To one horse rather than several So I continue being pulled but one way Racing around a new marble that doesn’t need you Or need to dim the sun Please drag me along As I lob inverted curses and cast some subversive spells I’ll trade you my time For a reason and a worthwhile ride I know it’s not much But it’s all I can give that I’m sure is mine My heavy hand Weighs in and with each pound a line And you can’t show up To the ritual without a sacrifice',

I found fire when I was 12 It’s lasted over twenty years And I can count on one finger The people that can hurt me now So work comes first I’m sorry if I shut off Never been able to do both So I keep my nose down And if it means a movie alone It could be worse.',

          lyrics:
            'Morning comes with birds and kids talking to themselves For some reason And wrists can vibrate at a comfortable rate To get you to sleep or keep you from it He wears that hole in his shoe with real grace And if he wears it right he just might have A leg up on everyone, but it’d feel so good They’d all watch him tie those gold laces And they become things he can’t stop tying Becoming grateful and bitter for his brand new handicap And holding the ropes that he’d been thrust upon He can’t get his hands off his feet to enjoy the walk Now it’s tough to tell if ever he was real Just knows the crunch of his new boots crushes all special snowflake Choke the evil out Smoke the evil out Stroke the evil out Choke the evil out It’s satisfied by removing chunks of dead skin It turns it on the same way It couldn’t keep a straight face staring at it, it turns it on With that mirror you force yourself to stare And you stink of the holiness they soaked you in It ends up driving you bored and drinking you numb So special for a minute, though. He wears that hole in his shoe with the same face And if he wears it right he just might have To keep that leg up on everyone Because it feels so good They’d all watch him tie those gold laces And they become things he can’t stop tying Gratefully bitter for that old handicap And gripping the ropes that he holds himself on Feet paraded on high as his hands take the walk Now it’s tough to tell if ever he was real Just knows the crunch of those old boots keeps him a special snowflake',

            'Dreams of wearing Mother’s pearls With her bright red lipstick on Chest out like a proud son Everything covered in form A strangled lust was thrown To float into death alone. You miss the things that turn you pink But those acts can’t be touched And neither can you Nor speak it straight A shriek that ran out of gas prompts yawns that you try and hide Why wait for death When you can achieve senility I love you so much but I just might run out It all means so much but it never matters enough.',

And why is it wearing those clothes? Thanks for the scissors That I haven’t used I thought you were Moses But I got confused Why am I north of you? Sigh on my boring tooth Lie, it’d be nice of you I think I’m trying too hard Soap and water On your daughter To get her as clean as she was At the time you bought her Before you caught her Swimming in oil and fuzz Stop picking at it It’ll never heal Stroked it till the pus came out wrong Scarred as you came Spread out thinly on A carpet made of hair Talking with everyone but no one’s actually there            ',

I thought that I should ask I stare up at you and wonder how I could ever live inside Only to crawl up into your womb That I manipulate for a modern life Let’s take off all our clothes and all of our names I’m sick of being scared of being sick All of my files were fucked and confused And they already made me cut off my dick I think I fucked myself It might have fucked you too Is that alright?

I throw out all my old calendars By tossing them in the lake. They’re all secured a few feet from shore And then I shoot myself into space. I want it at rope’s length If it’s not being used.

It was then that I noticed my finger bleeding I, for one, blame the thumb You can find the room’s exit In that it’s just a handful of walls Not one thing is everything And not everything has a meaning But you can lie You can always lie The sense of defeat was strong and in its season of feeding And the broom was all numb and all the sponges now needy So I laid out on the floor.',

            'I sit with my bouquet Plucking petals torturously I have no mercy I set the bar real high and come up just shy And then pound my desk with the utmost frustration But it runs! just enough! It’s fine! I keep a good attitude! But I’ll never be Elvis I guess. Just one big moist bag of garbage Missing the low hum that connects things A dumpy woman in a tracksuit It’s all the same to me, man. I can send mail, cook food and complete other simple tasks If required My resume, while less than impressive, is consistent. I’m at the mercy of machines. Out of context, That could sound like a real problem But it’s only in pictures Always only in pictures          ',

            'My name is Darryl Fish and I changed when I turned 21 I used to feel the sun’s warmth on my arms Now the sky just opens up. I pull the sheets over my head and try hard To disappear. But in bed with me is A zoo of formless tenants that I wrestle with They burrow into me and push out through my limbs. They find their way out. Woke up in the middle of the ocean With everyone without faces. “I only want this thing to drift and I’ll cut any rope that’s got an anchor on it and if you try to keep us here I’ll drill a hole at my feet if I need.” Then the choir surrounds him and they push their song That always seems off I wouldn’t call them wrong I just wouldn’t ask them at all “I wonder if my fate has been taped to my back because all their eyes look like they’re reading me as forms I was supposed to have filled out but it’s all paperwork I don’t need to have” Floats hands behind head And then he sees the choir Pulling the ship off into the sky gaping open It’s dark now, and he wonders when The sun will come up and how it’ll feel on his skin and if it will at all',

            'A dog to you or anyone Who will provide protection, Keep intact my shoebox, house my bones. There are magnets on the ceiling That pull half of the left side of your lips up. I made them work strong because while I work in physics I’m also a plumber by trade, so. I pull down eyebrows while I know my knees will buckle I’ll still amble in. The latrine was filled with holy water and all sorts of things we have in common Shaved my entire body. Took a bath Made the water as hot as I could tried to sleep and then figure out some math equation That I must’ve been given as a kid How she must’ve felt when the shaved side of her head started growing back. Then the age sets in to need something Tries to fit inside his shaved suit I need to need something clean He’s a dog to anyone, just let him eat.          ',

The steam makes me restless. I wish it would put me to bed. Tried to watch from my fourth wall but I can’t see three more in it. Only the back of a tooth in the distance and that warm pulsing breeze. I must be sitting inside but I won’t let it swallow. I feel my veins start to swell, they flood back, Pumping fire out of me. I see its jaw start to close. Pull out and show it its teeth. I’ll breathe the stink of its hot breath. I’ll become it’s dream And I’ll make it drink from my breast. Opened wide the tongue reaches up so I can give it a soft kiss I feel my tits start to grow. I fill them with joy and let them overflow.          ',

But I can’t rely on getting handed a book of matches every time. I wish it were direct where things can go But only pictures, always pictures. Covered in dust that I ate from a bag At a place we bought gas. Hobbling into childhood again He’ll thank me for my blessing, I barely keep in touch. It’s the same place on a map but most things have turned over.          ',

Jumps out the chest and starts running at the walls It’s losing its shit and swears there’s a room outside this one.
